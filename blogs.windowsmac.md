## Conclusion?
Well, synthesizing the above resources, it seems it's quite based upon personal preference (although, it does seem the attitudes around Apple products and Microsoft under Satya Nadella are shifting ). If you plan to develop extensively for mobile, you should surely go with a Mac. It will be interesting to see how the conversation shifts as Microsoft develops the bash shell further (one of the main reasons for avoiding a PC). 

Of note: this girl thinks [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) can't be beat, and that's reason enough to turn towards a Windows system.
